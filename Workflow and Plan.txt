Workflow
Height/weight/picture/video uploaded
movenet rigs up joints on the body and vectorizes distances between the joints
CNN to identify the type of lift
connect to database and use KNN to find most similar powerlifter to you for that particular lift
Access a resources part of the database for that particular lifter with links to websites for videos and programs for that particular lifter.

Plan:
Classes: database class: connecting/querying, rig class: use movenet and store vectorized points/height/weight, main: using database and rig classes and KNN to identify lifter, and train CNN model
Database: Top 100 IPF Lifters
